# alf-conf

`alf.conf` is a personal configuration file for [Alf](https://github.com/DannyBen/alf) (enhances the bash alias management).

It can be edited directly by any text editor or by using `alf e`.

After editing the `alf.conf` file, use:

```bash
alf save				# saving to /home/vagrant/.bash_aliases
source ~/.bash_aliases	# applying the new aliases to the current session
```
